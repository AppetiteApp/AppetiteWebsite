Issues: who should enter whether or not the meal is picked up?

UserID: {
	//active meals are moved to past meals once they're picked up 
	activeMeals: [
		{
			dishId: String,
			chefId: String,
			pending: Boolean, //true if chef didn't respond yet, false if chef responded
			confirmed: Boolean, //true if chef accepts, false is chef declines
			requestTime: Date, //time when user made the request
			secretCode: String, //automatically generated code for picking up meal
			pickedUp: Boolean 
		}
	],
	pastPurchases: [
		{
			dishId: String,
			chefId: String,
			review: {
				taste: Number, // out of 5
				punctuality: Number,
				comment: String
			}
		}
	]
}

DishId: {
	portions: Number,
	purchases: [
		{
			buyerId: String,
			responded: Boolean, //false by default, when chef accepts or declines a purchase request, changes to True
			confirmed: Boolean, 
			pickedUp: Boolean,
			secretCode: String, //same as the user's code
			pickedUp: Boolean 
		}
	]
}


User Story:
1. a user sees a dish that's not theirs, clicks "request dish" to request the meal; user sees "pending" next to the meal they requested
2. the chef sees that someone has requested the meal, either "accept" or "decline"
	2.1) chef accepts the meal request, the user sees "confirmed: {{confirmCode}}" next to the dish
	2.2) chef declines the meal request, but must give reason: [no more portions left, user's rating low, etc]
3)
