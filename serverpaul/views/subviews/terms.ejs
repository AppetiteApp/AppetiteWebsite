        <h3 class="smallheadingterms">2. WEBSITE ACCESS AND TERMS</h3>
        <p>2.1. Website access: You may access some areas of the Website without making a Cooking request or registering your details with us. Most areas of the Website are open to everyone. To request cooking or to post plates, you will need to sign up to the Appetite community, accept our terms and conditions and then request cooking or post your plates.</p>
        <p>2.2. Acceptance of terms: By accessing any part of the Website, you indicate that you accept these Website Terms. If you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to request any Products or you’re your plates through the Website.</p>
        <p>2.3. Revision of terms: We may revise these Website Terms at any time. You should check the Website regularly to review the current Website Terms, because they are binding on you. You will be subject to the policies and terms and conditions in force at the time that you place a Request through us and/or at the time you upload and share a plate. By agreeing to the terms and conditions, you are agreeing that you will be checking our terms and conditions regularly for any updates.</p>
        <p>2.4. Responsibility: You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Website. You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Website through your Internet connection are aware of these Website Terms and that they comply with them.</p>
        <h3 class="smallheadingterms">3. YOUR STATUS</h3>
        <p>3.1. Capacity and age: By placing a Request through the Website, you warrant that:</p>
        <p>3.1.1. You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and</p>
        <p>3.1.2. You are at least 18 years old.</p>
        <h3 class="smallheadingterms">4. HOW TO MAKE A COOKING REQUEST AND HOW IT IS PROCESSED</h3>
        <p>Disclaimer:  By joining the Appetite community you understand and agree that you are not requesting food from licensed chefs, food handlers cooking in commercial kitchens although these will apply to some of our users. By agreeing to the terms and conditions you agree not to hold Appetite liable for any bodily harm, food safety/quality hygiene issues. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you clearly state that you understand that Appetite is a community built around food: people sell/buy food that they cook for themselves or their families. If the food is cooked for any other reasons by any of the users, you agree not to hold Appetite liable for it.
    Cooks might not be licensed restaurateurs, might not have taken the food handling certificate or hygiene course. Cooks are part of the Appetite community. You understand that requesting cooking from cooks is like visiting your neighbor and eating at their place or taking food from your neighbor to eat at home- by that we mean that you agree to request food from an unlicensed and uncertified cook. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you agree to join our community and to not hold Appetite or any cook liable for any issues with the food you request. We don’t assume any responsibility for any issues with the food up to and including hygiene, quality and preparation time. We encourage everyone who wants to share their food to take the food handlers course available at www.mapaq.gouv.qc.ca. Appetite does not guarantee quality or hygiene of the premises of the cooks; it is through our technology that we enable users to check for themselves. As a consumer you herby agree that you will request food from cooks you trust.
    You understand that by requesting food for pick-up, you are responsible for picking up the food after you pay for it on www.eatappetite.com .  Appetite is not responsible for any delivery delays, injuries, accidents you might be involved in, while in the process of picking up your food. If upon arrival at the pickup location you realize that the food is not available for you, you need to contact Appetite customer service immediately so they can rectify the situation. Under no circumstances are you to harass or intimidate the cook if he/she does not have the food you paid for.
    Being a platform for users to sell their food, Appetite cannot guarantee that there will be plates available to request at all time on its platform.
  </p>
  <p>4.1. Compiling your Request: Once you have selected the Products you wish to request, and provided the other required information, you will be given the opportunity to submit your Request by clicking or selecting the "proceed", "place my request", “check out” or similar button. It is important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button; once you do so we will start processing your Request and errors cannot be corrected.</p>
  <p>4.2. Amending or cancelling your Request: Once you have submitted your Request and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Request, nor will you be entitled to a refund (please refer to paragraph 4.4 for details of the process relating to rejected Requests). If you wish to change or cancel your Request, you should contact our Customer Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Cook in request to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Cook or that the Cook will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Request.</p>
  <p>4.3. Payment authorisation: Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Cooking request will not be processed or communicated to the relevant Cook.</p>
  <h3 class="smallheadingterms">5. PRICE AND PAYMENT</h3>
  <p>5.1. Prices will be as quoted on the Website. Any errors in charging your payment card should be communicated to Appetite immediately with proof (i.e. bank statement, receipt…). Appetite will take immediate actions to return to you any amount of money wrongly charged to you.</p>
  <p>5.2. Payment methods: Payment for Requests must be made by an accepted credit card through the Website. Individuals that are signed up to one of Appetite’s plans agree to have the meal price withdrawn from their credit account after every meal order. Individuals will be charged for their requests upon pressing “check-out”, “proceed” or any similar button. Prices of the same plates will vary between cooks depending on the pricing each cook sets.</p>
  <p>Appetite charges commissions on each transaction as a means of revenue for the company. By agreeing to these terms and conditions you clearly state that you accept that Appetite reserves the right to charge the commission amount it wants. Currently, Appetite charges 2.1% + Stripe transaction fees. You also clearly state that you understand and accept that this scheme applies to each cooking request you receive. You accept any major changes in commission charges without prior notice. You also accept that Appetite charge you any additional amount it deems as a new revenue stream. Although Appetite will attempt to communicate any new revenue streams to cooks, it cannot guarantee that all changes in revenue may streams will be communicated in a timely manner to all users.</p>
  <p>5.3. Card payments: Please note that from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments and transactions; this may result in payments taking up to sixty (60) days to be deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit card.</p>
  <h3 class="smallheadingterms">6. CUSTOMER CARE</h3>
        <p>6.1. General: If you are having any problems with your Request, our Customer Care team will try to assist you where possible (subject to resource availability). You can contact our Customer Care team by calling the number on the website, or emailing the address on the website.</p>

        <p>6.4. Complaints or feedback: In the event that you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Cook, please consider providing feedback in the form of ratings, comments and reviews on the Website (together, "Reviews") to reflect your experience. The Reviews are an important part of our quality control process. Since we are launching a beta version, we strongly rely on your feedback reviews and ratings.</p>
        <p>6.5. Compensation: If you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products and wish to seek a refund, a proportionate price reduction or any other compensation, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above within 48 hours of placing your Request and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Cook in request to request compensation on your behalf. Please note that we have no control over Cooks and the quality of the Products that they provide, and we are not able to provide, and have no responsibility or liability for providing, any compensation to you on behalf of any Cook. You will only be refunded the amount that the cook charged for your request and not the website fee (including the refund transaction fee if applicable).</p>
