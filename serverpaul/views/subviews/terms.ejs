	<h2 class="headingterms">I. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE AND SALE</h2>
	<h3 class="smallheadingterms">1. INTRODUCTION AND OUR ROLE</h3>
	<p>1.1. Service: We provide a platform which connects people interested in buying or selling home food. Our platform gives users the ability to communicate their requests ("Requests") for products ("Products") and for users who are cooking ("Cooks") to receive the Requests. Appetite also provides delivery and standard packaging for plates available for delivery. Please see paragraph 11 for important information regarding the legal relationship between users and Appetite.</p>
	<h3 class="smallheadingterms">2. WEBSITE ACCESS AND TERMS</h3>
	<p>2.1. Website access: You may access some areas of the Website without making a Cooking request or registering your details with us. Most areas of the Website are open to everyone. To request cooking or to post plates, you will need to sign up to the Appetite community, accept our terms and conditions and then request cooking or post your plates.</p>
	<p>2.2. Acceptance of terms: By accessing any part of the Website, you indicate that you accept these Website Terms. If you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to request any Products or you’re your plates through the Website.</p>
	<p>2.3. Revision of terms: We may revise these Website Terms at any time. You should check the Website regularly to review the current Website Terms, because they are binding on you. You will be subject to the policies and terms and conditions in force at the time that you place a Request through us and/or at the time you upload and share a plate. By agreeing to the terms and conditions, you are agreeing that you will be checking our terms and conditions regularly for any updates.</p>
	<p>2.4. Responsibility: You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Website. You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Website through your Internet connection are aware of these Website Terms and that they comply with them.</p>
	<h3 class="smallheadingterms">3. YOUR STATUS</h3>
	<p>3.1. Capacity and age: By placing a Request through the Website, you warrant that:</p>
	<p>3.1.1. You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and</p>
	<p>3.1.2. You are at least 18 years old.</p>
	<h3 class="smallheadingterms">4. HOW TO MAKE A COOKING REQUEST AND HOW IT IS PROCESSED</h3>
	<p>Disclaimer:  By joining the Appetite community you understand and agree that you are not requesting food from licensed chefs, food handlers cooking in commercial kitchens although these will apply to some of our users. By agreeing to the terms and conditions you agree not to hold Appetite liable for any bodily harm, food safety/quality hygiene issues. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you clearly state that you understand that Appetite is a community built around food: people sell/buy food that they cook for themselves or their families. If the food is cooked for any other reasons by any of the users, you agree not to hold Appetite liable for it.
Cooks might not be licensed restaurateurs, might not have taken the food handling certificate or hygiene course. Cooks are part of the Appetite community. You understand that requesting cooking from cooks is like visiting your neighbor and eating at their place or taking food from your neighbor to eat at home- by that we mean that you agree to request food from an unlicensed and uncertified cook. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you agree to join our community and to not hold Appetite or any cook liable for any issues with the food you request. We don’t assume any responsibility for any issues with the food up to and including hygiene, quality and preparation time. We encourage everyone who wants to share their food to take the food handlers course available at www.mapaq.gouv.qc.ca. Appetite does not guarantee quality or hygiene of the premises of the cooks; it is through our technology that we enable users to check for themselves. As a consumer you herby agree that you will request food from cooks you trust.
You understand that by requesting food for pick-up, you are responsible for picking up the food after you pay for it on www.eatappetite.com .  Appetite is not responsible for any delivery delays, injuries, accidents you might be involved in, while in the process of picking up your food. If upon arrival at the pickup location you realize that the food is not available for you, you need to contact Appetite customer service immediately so they can rectify the situation. Under no circumstances are you to harass or intimidate the cook if he/she does not have the food you paid for.
Being a platform for users to sell their food, Appetite cannot guarantee that there will be plates available to request at all time on its platform.
